# atproto starter kit

Use this as a template repo. Requires Node 18+ with typescript and ts-node installed globally (`npm i -g typescript ts-node`). Add your bluesky username and password to `.env` then run your app with `npm run start` or `ts-node-esm index.ts`.

I recommend using `eslint` (for linting) and `prettier` (for enforcing code style) in your chosen text editor (or from the command line).

@ me on bluesky (@aliceisjustplaying.bsky.social, did:plc:by3jhwdqgbtrcc7q4tkkv3cf) if you've built something interesting with it!
